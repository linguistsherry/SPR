<b>Instructions</b>
</p>

<p>
In the experiment, you are going to be reading each sentence as a series of word "chunks". To do this, the experiment will only show one part of the sentence at a time. When a sentence first appears, it will look like a series of dashes, like this:
</p>
<p>
— —
</p>
<p>
To read the sentence, you will press the <b>spacebar</b>. This will cause the current words to disappear, and will reveal the next part of the sentence. So when you press the spacebar for the first time, the display changes to look something like this:
</p>
<p>
<u>The silver</u> 
</p>
And when you press it again, that first phrase disappears to reveal the next part of the sentence.
</p>
<p>
 <u>needs polishing</u>.
</p>
Continue hitting the spacebar all the way through to the end of the sentence, revealing sentence pieces so that you are reading at normal pace for you. You will be asked to take a short break for 10 seconds every now and then between sentences, but please do not do so when you are in the middle of a sentence. Try to avoid going too slow, but don't go so fast that you can't answer the comprehension question at the end! <b>Note: Please read each sentence silently to yourself. Do not read out loud!</b>
